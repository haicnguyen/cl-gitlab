* Minimalistic interface to Gitlab's api

A work in progress.

** Authentication

There is no need to authenticate to query public projects.

Otherwise, you will need to  manually set the =*private-token*= (until
we implement a better way).

Create      a       token      on      your       Gitlab      profile:
[[https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html][https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html]]
and then:

: (setf gitlab:access-token "secret")


** Base function: request

With =request method "path" :params  (alist) :data= you can access all
the api.

: (gitlab:request :GET "/projects")

The other functions are only helpers.

** Getting a project

: (gitlab:project "username/project")


[[https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/projects.html#get-single-project][endpoint documentation]].


* More

Inspired by [[https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab][glab.el]].

It follows  a minimalistic  approach so you  better read  Gitlab's API
documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/  The goal is
that if their API changes, our library doesn't break.
