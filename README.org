* Minimalistic interface to Gitlab's api

A work in progress.

: (gitlab:request :GET "/projects")

You must login beforehand or manually set the =*private-token*=:

: (gitlab:get-access-token)

Inspired by [[https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab][glab.el]].

It follows  a minimalistic  approach so you  better read  Gitlab's API
documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/  The real  advantage is
that if their API changes, our library doesn't break.
