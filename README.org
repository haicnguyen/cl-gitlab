* Interface to Gitlab's api

This lib is working but still considered a work in progress.

: (gitlab--request :GET "/projects")

You must login beforehand or manually set the =gitlab--private-token=:

: (gitlab--get-access-token)

Inspired by [[https://gitlab.com/tarsius/glab][glab.el]].

It follows  a minimalistic  approach so you  better read  Gitlab's API
documentation: https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/api/  The real  advantage is
that if their API changes, our library doesn't break.

It is not on Quicklisp. Just ask if you need :)
